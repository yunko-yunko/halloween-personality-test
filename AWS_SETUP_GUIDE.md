# üöÄ AWS Setup Guide for Halloween Personality Test

This guide will help you configure AWS resources (specifically AWS SES for email) to enable the advanced mode with email authentication.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- An AWS account ([Sign up here](https://aws.amazon.com/))
- A verified email address or domain
- AWS CLI installed (optional but recommended)

---

## üéØ Overview

The Halloween Personality Test uses **AWS SES (Simple Email Service)** to send:
1. **Verification emails** - Magic link for user authentication
2. **Result emails** - Test results sent to users (optional feature)

---

## üìù Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create an AWS Account

1. Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/)
2. Click "Create an AWS Account"
3. Follow the registration process
4. Add payment method (AWS Free Tier includes 62,000 emails/month for free!)

---

### Step 2: Set Up AWS SES

#### 2.1 Access SES Console

1. Log in to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Search for "SES" in the services search bar
3. Click on "Simple Email Service"
4. **Important:** Select your region (e.g., `us-east-1`) - remember this!

#### 2.2 Verify Your Email Address

**For Development/Testing:**

1. In SES Console, go to **"Verified identities"**
2. Click **"Create identity"**
3. Select **"Email address"**
4. Enter your email (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)
5. Click **"Create identity"**
6. Check your email inbox
7. Click the verification link in the email from AWS
8. Wait for status to change to **"Verified"**

**Example:**
```
From Email: noreply@yourdomain.com
Status: Verified ‚úì
```

#### 2.3 Verify Recipient Emails (Sandbox Mode)

By default, AWS SES is in **Sandbox mode**, which means:
- You can only send emails to verified addresses
- Limited to 200 emails per day
- 1 email per second

**To test in Sandbox:**
1. Verify your test email addresses (same process as above)
2. You can now send emails to these verified addresses

**To move to Production:**
1. In SES Console, click **"Account dashboard"**
2. Click **"Request production access"**
3. Fill out the form explaining your use case
4. Wait for AWS approval (usually 24-48 hours)

---

### Step 3: Create IAM User for SES

#### 3.1 Access IAM Console

1. Go to [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Click **"Users"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Create user"**

#### 3.2 Configure User

1. **User name:** `halloween-test-ses-user`
2. **Access type:** Select "Access key - Programmatic access"
3. Click **"Next"**

#### 3.3 Set Permissions

1. Click **"Attach policies directly"**
2. Search for **"AmazonSESFullAccess"**
3. Check the box next to it
4. Click **"Next"**
5. Click **"Create user"**

#### 3.4 Save Credentials

**IMPORTANT:** You'll see your credentials only once!

```
Access Key ID: AKIA...
Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

**Save these immediately!** You'll need them for your `.env` file.

---

### Step 4: Configure Backend Environment

#### 4.1 Update `.env` File

Navigate to your backend directory and edit `.env`:

```bash
cd backend
```

Edit `.env` file:

```env
# Enable Advanced Mode
ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTH=true

# AWS SES Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

# Frontend URL (for email links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Database Configuration (also required for advanced mode)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=halloween_test
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password

# JWT Secret (generate a secure random string)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-at-least-32-characters-long
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
```

#### 4.2 Generate JWT Secret

Use one of these methods:

**Node.js:**
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

**OpenSSL:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Online Generator:**
- Visit: https://randomkeygen.com/
- Use a "CodeIgniter Encryption Key" (256-bit)

---

### Step 5: Test Your Configuration

#### 5.1 Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
Server running on port 3000
Feature mode: Advanced (email authentication enabled)
AWS SES configured for region: us-east-1
```

#### 5.2 Test Email Sending

**Option 1: Use the Frontend**
1. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Start Test"
4. Enter your verified email address
5. Check your inbox for verification email

**Option 2: Use curl**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/send-verification \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"your-verified-email@example.com"}'
```

#### 5.3 Verify Email Received

Check your inbox for an email like:
```
From: noreply@yourdomain.com
Subject: üéÉ Ìï†Î°úÏúà ÏÑ±Í≤© ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏ - Ïù¥Î©îÏùº Ïù∏Ï¶ù

[Email with verification button]
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Email not sending"

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ Email address is verified in SES Console
2. ‚úÖ AWS credentials are correct in `.env`
3. ‚úÖ AWS region matches SES configuration
4. ‚úÖ IAM user has `AmazonSESFullAccess` permission
5. ‚úÖ Backend is running with `ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTH=true`

**Test AWS credentials:**

# Mac: brew install awscli

# Configure credentials
aws configure

# Test SES
aws ses verify-email-identity --email-address test@example.com --region us-east-1
```

---

### Issue: "MessageRejected: Email address is not verified"

**Solution:**
- You're in Sandbox mode
- Verify the recipient email address in SES Console
- OR request production access

---

### Issue: "Invalid AWS credentials"

**Check:**
1. Access Key ID starts with `AKIA`
2. Secret Access Key is the full string (no spaces)
3. No quotes around values in `.env` file
4. IAM user has correct permissions

**Regenerate credentials:**
1. Go to IAM Console
2. Find your user
3. Go to "Security credentials" tab
4. Click "Create access key"
5. Update `.env` with new credentials

---

### Issue: "Rate exceeded"

**Sandbox limits:**
- 200 emails per day
- 1 email per second

**Solution:**
- Request production access
- OR wait 24 hours for limit reset

---

## üí∞ AWS Pricing

### SES Pricing (as of 2024)

**Free Tier:**
- 62,000 emails per month (when sending from EC2)
- 3,000 emails per month (when sending from other sources)

**After Free Tier:**
- $0.10 per 1,000 emails sent
- $0.12 per GB of attachments

**Example costs:**
- 10,000 emails/month: ~$1.00
- 100,000 emails/month: ~$10.00

**For this app:**
- Verification emails only (no attachments)
- Very low cost even with many users
- Free tier should cover most development/testing

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Commit Credentials

**Add to `.gitignore`:**
```
.env
.env.local
.env.production
```

### 2. Use IAM Roles in Production

For production deployment (EC2, Lambda, etc.):
- Use IAM roles instead of access keys
- Attach `AmazonSESFullAccess` policy to role
- No need to store credentials in `.env`

### 3. Rotate Access Keys

- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Delete unused keys
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for production

### 4. Limit Permissions

Instead of `AmazonSESFullAccess`, create custom policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ses:SendEmail",
        "ses:SendRawEmail"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìß Email Templates

The app includes two email templates:

### 1. Verification Email
- Subject: "üéÉ Ìï†Î°úÏúà ÏÑ±Í≤© ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏ - Ïù¥Î©îÏùº Ïù∏Ï¶ù"
- Contains magic link for authentication
- Link expires in 24 hours
- HTML and plain text versions

### 2. Result Email (Optional)
- Subject: "üéÉ ÎãπÏã†Ïùò Ìï†Î°úÏúà Ï∫êÎ¶≠ÌÑ∞Îäî [Character]ÏûÖÎãàÎã§!"
- Contains test result and character description
- Link to profile page
- HTML and plain text versions

**Customize templates:**
Edit `backend/src/services/implementations/SESEmailService.ts`
